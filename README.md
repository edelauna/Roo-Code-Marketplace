This template provides a basic structure for creating a package manager source repository. The structure follows the required format for Roo Code's package manager.

## Structure

```
/
├── metadata.en.yml         # Required: Repository metadata
└── mcp servers/           # Required: At least one of: mcp servers, roles, storage systems, or items
    └── example-server/    
        └── metadata.en.yml
```

## Required Files

### Root metadata.en.yml
```yaml
name: "Your Repository Name"
description: "Your repository description"
version: "1.0.0"
```

### MCP Server metadata.en.yml
```yaml
name: "Your MCP Server Name"
description: "Your MCP server description"
type: "mcp server"
version: "1.0.0"
```

## Usage

1. Copy this template to create your own package manager repository
