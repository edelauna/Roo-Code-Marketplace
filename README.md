## Item Structure, Metadata, and Features

### Overview

* Every component on the registry is an `item`.
* An `item` can be of type: `mcp`, `mode`, `prompt`, `package`
* Each item apart from `package` is a singular object, i.e: one mode, one mcp server.
* A `package` contains multiple other `item`s
  * All internal sub-items of a `package` is contained in the binary on the `package` item metadata itself.
* Each `item` requires specific metadata files and follows a consistent directory structure.

### Directory Structure

The `registry` structure could be the root or placed in a `registry` directory of any `git` repository, a sample structure for a registry is:

```
registry/
├── metadata.en.yml               # Required metadata for the registry
│
├── modes/                        # `mode` items
│   └── a-mode-name/
│       └── metadata.en.yml
├── mcps/                         # `mcp` items
├── prompts/                      # `prompt` items
│
└── packages/                     # `package` items
    └── a-package-name/
        ├── metadata.en.yml       # Required metadata
        ├── metadata.fr.yml       # Optional localized metadata (French)
        ├── modes/                # `a-package-name`'s internal `mode` items
        │   └── my-mode/
        │       └── metadata.en.yml
        ├── mcps/                 # `a-package-name`'s internal `mcp` items
        │   └── my-server/
        │       └── metadata.en.yml
        └── prompts/              # `a-package-name`'s internal `prompt` items
            └── my-prompt/
                └── metadata.en.yml
```

### Metadata File Format

Metadata files use YAML format and must include specific fields:

#### `registry`:
```yaml
name: "My Registry"
description: "A concise description for your registry"
version: "0.0.0"
author: "your name" # optional
authorUrl: "http://your.profile.url/" # optional
```

#### `item`:
```yaml
name: "My Package"
description: "A concise description for your package"
version: "0.0.0"
type: "package" # One of: package, mode, mcp, prompt
sourceUrl: "https://url.to/source-repository" # Optional
binaryUrl: "https://url.to/binary.zip"
binaryHash: "SHA256-of-binary"
binarySource: "https://proof.of/source" # Optional, proof-of-source for the binary (tag/hash reference, build job, etc)
tags:
    - tag1
    - tag2
author: "your name" # optional
authorUrl: "http://your.profile.url/" # optional
```

### Localization Support

You can provide metadata in multiple languages by using locale-specific files:

**Important Notes on Localization:**

- Only files with the pattern `metadata.{locale}.yml` are supported
- The Marketplace will display metadata in the user's locale if available
- If the user's locale is not available, it will fall back to English
- The English locale (`metadata.en.yml`) is required as a fallback
- Files without a locale code (e.g., just `metadata.yml`) are not supported

### Configurable Support

Powered with [**`Roo Rocket`**](https://github.com/NamesMT/roo-rocket), the registry supports configurable items like:
+ `mcp` with access token inputs.
+ `mode` / `prompt` with feature flags.
+ And further customizations that a creator can imagine.
  + E.g: a `package` could prompt you for the location of its context folder.

## Contributing Process

To contribute your package to the official repository, follow these steps:

### 1. Fork the Repository

1. Visit the official Roo Code Packages repository: [https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code-Marketplace](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code-Marketplace)
2. Click the "Fork" button in the top-right corner
3. This creates your own copy of the repository where you can make changes

### 2. Clone Your Fork

Clone your forked repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Roo-Code-Marketplace.git
cd Roo-Code-Marketplace
```

### 3. Create Your Item

1. Create a new directory for your item with an appropriate name
2. Add the required metadata files (and subitem directories for `package`)
3. Follow the structure and format described above
4. Add `sourceUrl` that points to a repository or post with info/document for the item.

Example of creating a simple package:

```bash
mkdir -p my-package/modes/my-mode
touch my-package/metadata.en.yml
touch my-package/README.md
touch my-package/modes/my-mode/metadata.en.yml
```

### 4. Test Your Package

Before submitting, test your package by adding your fork as a custom source in the Marketplace:

1. In VS Code, open the Marketplace
2. Go to the "Settings" tab
3. Click "Add Source"
4. Enter your fork's URL (e.g., `https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Roo-Code-Marketplace`)
5. Click "Add"
6. Verify that your package appears and functions correctly

### 5. Commit and Push Your Changes

Once you're satisfied with your package:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add my-package with mode component"
git push origin main
```

### 6. Create a Pull Request

1. Go to the original repository: [https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code-Marketplace](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code-Marketplace)
2. Click "Pull Requests" and then "New Pull Request"
3. Click "Compare across forks"
4. Select your fork as the head repository
5. Click "Create Pull Request"
6. Provide a clear title and description of your package
7. Submit the pull request

### 7. Review Process

After submitting your pull request:

1. Maintainers will review your package
2. They may request changes or improvements
3. Once approved, your package will be merged into the main repository
4. Your package will be available to all users of the Marketplace

## Best Practices

- **Clear Documentation**: Include detailed documentation in your README.md
- **Descriptive Metadata**: Write clear, informative descriptions
- **Appropriate Tags**: Use relevant tags to make your package discoverable
- **Testing**: Thoroughly test your package before submitting
- **Localization**: Consider providing metadata in multiple languages
- **Semantic Versioning**: Follow semantic versioning for version numbers
- **Consistent Naming**: Use clear, descriptive names for components

## Example package metadatas

### Data Science Toolkit

Here's an example of a data science package:

**data-science-toolkit/metadata.en.yml**:

```yaml
name: "Data Science Toolkit"
description: "A comprehensive collection of tools for data science workflows"
version: "1.0.0"
type: "package"
tags:
    - data
    - science
    - analysis
    - visualization
    - machine learning
```

**data-science-toolkit/modes/data-scientist-mode/metadata.en.yml**:

```yaml
name: "Data Scientist Mode"
description: "A specialized mode for data science tasks"
version: "1.0.0"
type: "mode"
tags:
    - data
    - science
    - analysis
```

**data-science-toolkit/prompts/data-cleaning/metadata.en.yml**:

```yaml
name: "Data Cleaning Prompt"
description: "A prompt for cleaning and preprocessing datasets"
version: "1.0.0"
type: "prompt"
tags:
    - data
    - cleaning
    - preprocessing
```

## Adding Custom Marketplace Sources

The Marketplace allows you to extend its functionality by adding custom sources. [**This guide**](./marketplace-sources.md) explains how to set up and manage your own Marktplace repositories to access additional components beyond the default offerings.
