# Adding Packages

This guide explains how to create and contribute your own packages to the Roo Code Package Manager. By following these steps, you can share your components with the community and help expand the ecosystem.

## Package Structure and Metadata

Each package in the Package Manager requires specific metadata files and follows a consistent directory structure.

### Directory Structure

The basic structure for a package is:

```
package-name/
├── metadata.en.yml       # Required metadata file (English)
├── metadata.fr.yml       # Optional localized metadata (French)
├── README.md             # Documentation for the package
├── modes/                # Directory for mode components
│   └── my-mode/
│       └── metadata.en.yml
├── mcp servers/          # Directory for MCP server components
│   └── my-server/
│       └── metadata.en.yml
└── prompts/              # Directory for prompt components
    └── my-prompt/
        └── metadata.en.yml
```

### Metadata File Format

Metadata files use YAML format and must include specific fields:

```yaml
name: "My Package"
description: "A detailed description of what this package does"
version: "1.0.0"
type: "package" # One of: package, mode, mcp server, prompt
author: "Your name"
authorUrl: "http://your.profile.url"
tags:
    - tag1
    - tag2
items: # Only for packages AND when a subcomponent isn't located in the packages directory tree
    - type: "prompt"
      path: "../shared-prompts/data-analysis" # Reference to component outside package directory
```

### Package Example in Source Tree

Here's how a package might look in the actual source tree:

```
Roo-Code-Packages/
├── shared-prompts/                # Shared prompts directory
│   └── data-analysis/
│       └── metadata.en.yml
│
└── data-toolkit/                  # Your package directory
    ├── metadata.en.yml            # Package metadata
    ├── metadata.fr.yml            # Localized metadata
    ├── README.md                  # Documentation
    ├── modes/                     # Modes directory
    │   └── data-analyst/
    │       └── metadata.en.yml
    └── mcp servers/               # MCP servers directory
        └── data-processor/
            └── metadata.en.yml
```

### Fields

- **name**: A clear, descriptive name for your component
- **description**: A detailed explanation of what your component does
- **version**: Semantic version number (e.g., "1.0.0")
- **type**: Component type (one of: "package", "mode", "mcp server", "prompt")
- **author**: (Optional) Your name, if you want it shown in Roo-Code
- **authorUrl**: (Optional) An http(s) link to your profile, github, linked-in, or something else that you want people to view when they click your name
- **tags**: (Optional) Array of relevant tags for filtering
- **items**: (Only for packages) Array of subcomponents with their type and path - when the path is not in the packages directory tree



### The Items Array and External References

The `items` array in a package's metadata serves only one important purposes:

**External Component References**: It allows referencing components that exist outside the package's directory tree.

Components that are within the package's directory tree are implicitly included and will be found at runtime.

#### Referencing External Components

You can reference components from anywhere in the repository by using relative paths:

```yaml
items:
    # Component within the package directory
    - type: "mode"
      path: "modes/my-mode"

    # Component outside the package directory (using relative path)
    - type: "prompt"
      path: "../shared-prompts/data-analysis"

    # Component from a completely different part of the repository
    - type: "mcp server"
      path: "../../other-category/useful-server"
```

This allows you to:

- Create shared components that can be used by multiple packages
- Organize components logically while maintaining package relationships
- Reference existing components without duplicating them

#### How It Works

- The `path` is relative to the package's directory
- The Package Manager resolves these paths when loading the package
- Components referenced this way appear as part of the package in the UI
- The same component can be included in multiple packages

### Localization Support

You can provide metadata in multiple languages by using locale-specific files:

**Important Notes on Localization:**

- Only files with the pattern `metadata.{locale}.yml` are supported
- The Package Manager will display metadata in the user's locale if available
- If the user's locale is not available, it will fall back to English
- The English locale (`metadata.en.yml`) is required as a fallback
- Files without a locale code (e.g., just `metadata.yml`) are not supported

## Contributing Process

To contribute your package to the official repository, follow these steps:

### 1. Fork the Repository

1. Visit the official Roo Code Packages repository: [https://github.com/RooVetGit/Roo-Code-Packages](https://github.com/RooVetGit/Roo-Code-Packages)
2. Click the "Fork" button in the top-right corner
3. This creates your own copy of the repository where you can make changes

### 2. Clone Your Fork

Clone your forked repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Roo-Code-Packages.git
cd Roo-Code-Packages
```

### 3. Create Your Package

1. Create a new directory for your package with an appropriate name
2. Add the required metadata files and component directories
3. Follow the structure and format described above
4. Add documentation in a README.md file

Example of creating a simple package:

```bash
mkdir -p my-package/modes/my-mode
touch my-package/metadata.en.yml
touch my-package/README.md
touch my-package/modes/my-mode/metadata.en.yml
```

### 4. Test Your Package

Before submitting, test your package by adding your fork as a custom source in the Package Manager:

1. In VS Code, open the Package Manager
2. Go to the "Settings" tab
3. Click "Add Source"
4. Enter your fork's URL (e.g., `https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Roo-Code-Packages`)
5. Click "Add"
6. Verify that your package appears and functions correctly

### 5. Commit and Push Your Changes

Once you're satisfied with your package:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add my-package with mode component"
git push origin main
```

### 6. Create a Pull Request

1. Go to the original repository: [https://github.com/RooVetGit/Roo-Code-Packages](https://github.com/RooVetGit/Roo-Code-Packages)
2. Click "Pull Requests" and then "New Pull Request"
3. Click "Compare across forks"
4. Select your fork as the head repository
5. Click "Create Pull Request"
6. Provide a clear title and description of your package
7. Submit the pull request

### 7. Review Process

After submitting your pull request:

1. Maintainers will review your package
2. They may request changes or improvements
3. Once approved, your package will be merged into the main repository
4. Your package will be available to all users of the Package Manager

## Best Practices

- **Clear Documentation**: Include detailed documentation in your README.md
- **Descriptive Metadata**: Write clear, informative descriptions
- **Appropriate Tags**: Use relevant tags to make your package discoverable
- **Testing**: Thoroughly test your package before submitting
- **Localization**: Consider providing metadata in multiple languages
- **Semantic Versioning**: Follow semantic versioning for version numbers
- **Consistent Naming**: Use clear, descriptive names for components

## Example Package

Here's a comprehensive example of a data science package that includes both internal components and references to external components:

**data-science-toolkit/metadata.en.yml**:

```yaml
name: "Data Science Toolkit"
description: "A comprehensive collection of tools for data science workflows"
version: "1.0.0"
type: "package"
tags:
    - data
    - science

    - visualization
    - machine learning
items:
    # External components (outside this package directory)
    - type: "prompt"
      path: "../shared-prompts/data-cleaning"
    - type: "mcp server"
      path: "../../ml-tools/model-trainer"
    - type: "mode"
      path: "../visualization-tools/chart-creator-mode"
```

version: "1.0.0"
type: "mode"
tags:
    - data
    - science
    - analysis
```

**shared-prompts/data-cleaning/metadata.en.yml**:

```yaml
name: "Data Cleaning Prompt"
description: "A prompt for cleaning and preprocessing datasets"
version: "1.0.0"
type: "prompt"
tags:
    - data
    - cleaning
    - preprocessing
```

# Adding Custom Package Sources

The Package Manager allows you to extend its functionality by adding custom package sources. This guide explains how to set up and manage your own package repositories to access additional components beyond the default offerings.

## Setting up a Package Source Repository

A package source repository is a Git repository that contains packages organized in a specific structure. You can create your own repository to host custom packages:

### Repository Requirements

1. **Proper Structure**: The repository must follow the required directory structure
2. **Valid Metadata**: Each package must include properly formatted metadata files
3. **Git Repository**: The source must be a Git repository accessible via HTTPS

### Creating a New Repository

1. Create a new repository on GitHub, GitLab, or another Git hosting service
2. Initialize the repository with a README.md file
3. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-package-repo.git
cd your-package-repo
```

4. Create the basic repository structure:

```bash
mkdir -p packages modes "mcp servers" prompts
touch metadata.en.yml
```

5. Add repository metadata to `metadata.en.yml`:

```yaml
name: "Your Repository Name"
description: "A collection of custom packages for Roo Code"
version: "1.0.0"
```

6. Commit and push the initial structure:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initialize package repository structure"
git push origin main
```

## Required Structure and Metadata

A package source repository must follow a specific structure to be properly recognized by the Package Manager:

### Repository Structure

```
repository-root/
├── metadata.en.yml           # Repository metadata
├── README.md                 # Repository documentation
├── packages/                 # Directory for package components
│   ├── package-1/
│   │   ├── metadata.en.yml   # Package metadata
│   │   └── README.md
│   └── package-2/
│       ├── metadata.en.yml
│       └── README.md
├── modes/                    # Directory for mode components
│   └── custom-mode/
│       └── metadata.en.yml
├── mcp servers/              # Directory for MCP server components
│   └── custom-server/
│       └── metadata.en.yml
└── prompts/                  # Directory for prompt components
    └── custom-prompt/
        └── metadata.en.yml
```

### Repository Metadata

The root `metadata.en.yml` file describes the repository itself:

```yaml
name: "Custom Components Repository"
description: "A collection of specialized components for data science workflows"
version: "1.0.0"
author: "Your Name or Organization"
tags:
    - custom
    - data-science
```

### Component Organization

- Components should be organized by type in their respective directories
- Each component must have its own directory containing a metadata file
- Components can be nested within packages
- Follow the same structure as described in [Adding Packages](./05-adding-packages.md)

## Adding Sources to Roo Code

Once you have a properly structured package source repository, you can add it to your Roo Code Package Manager:

### Default Package Source

Roo Code comes with a default package source - this GitHub location!:

- URL: `https://github.com/RooVetGit/Roo-Code-Packages`
- This source is enabled by default, and anytime all sources have been deleted.

### Adding a New Source

1. Open VS Code with the Roo Code extension
2. Navigate to the Package Manager
3. Switch to the "Sources" tab
4. Click the "Add Source" button
5. Enter the repository URL:
    - Format: `https://github.com/username/repository.git`
    - Example: `https://github.com/your-username/your-package-repo.git`
6. Click "Add" to save the source

### Managing Sources

The "Sources" tab provides several options for managing your package sources:

1. **Remove**: Delete a source from your configuration
2. **Refresh**: Update the package list from a sources - this is forced git clone/pull to override local caching of data

### Source Caching and Refreshing

Package Manager sources are cached to improve performance:

- **Cache Duration**: Sources are cached for 1 hour (3600000 ms)
- **Force Refresh**: To force an immediate refresh of a source:
    1. Go to the "Sources" tab
    2. Click the "Refresh" button next to the source you want to update
    3. This will bypass the cache and fetch the latest data from the repository

### Troubleshooting Sources

If a source isn't loading properly:

1. Check that the repository URL is correct
2. Ensure the repository follows the required structure
3. Look for error messages in the Package Manager interface
4. Try refreshing the sources list
5. Disable and re-enable the source

## Creating Private Sources

For team or organization use, you might want to create private package sources:

### Private Repository Setup

1. Create a private repository on your Git hosting service
2. Follow the same structure requirements as public repositories
3. Set up appropriate access controls for your team members

### Authentication Options

To access private repositories, you may need to:

1. Configure Git credentials on your system
2. Use a personal access token with appropriate permissions
3. Set up SSH keys for authentication

### Organization Best Practices

For teams and organizations:

1. Designate maintainers responsible for the package source
2. Establish quality standards for contributed packages
3. Create a review process for new additions
4. Document usage guidelines for team members
5. Consider implementing versioning for your packages

## Using Multiple Sources

The Package Manager supports multiple package sources simultaneously:

### Benefits of Multiple Sources

- Access components from different providers
- Separate internal and external components
- Test new packages before contributing them to the main repository
- Create specialized sources for different projects or teams

### Source Management Strategy

1. Keep the default source enabled for core components
2. Add specialized sources for specific needs
3. Create a personal source for testing and development
4. Refresh sources after you've pushed changes to them to get the latest components
